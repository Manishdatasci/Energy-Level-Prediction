# 🧠 Energy Level Prediction (ML + Rule-Based)

This project predicts a person's **Energy Level** (High / Medium / Low) using three daily habits:
- Sleep hours  
- Water intake  
- Screen time  

The project includes:
- Synthetic dataset generation  
- Rule-based scoring system  
- Random Forest ML model  
- Model saving/loading with pickle  
- Probability-based predictions

## 📌 Features
- Generates 100 synthetic samples for safe learning
- Clean rule-based logic for comparison
- ML pipeline with train/test split and evaluation
- Saves trained model (`energy_model.pkl`)
- Easy prediction functions for ML + Rule-Based outputs
